Created: January 2021

Purpose: The Inland EFH Mapping tool should be used as a guide to help inform users 
which locations may require an EFH consultation for a given project on coastal-, estuary-, 
or tributary-adjacent land for the Southeast Region (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina). This mapping tool is not a 
comprehensive EFH repository. Offshore EFH boundaries are not included in this tool. 
The focus of these layers is inland habitat along coastline, estuaries, and tributaries. 
Species and life stage boundaries may extend off the coast further than depicted. Life 
stages with offshore habitat ranges are not included in these layers.
